# Stock-Prices-Anomaly-Detection
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in stock prices using an LSTM autoencoder. It involves applying PCA-based analysis on stock data, creating and analyzing time series data, and implementing an LSTM autoencoder to identify anomalies based on reconstruction loss, including an analysis of the impact of events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
